# Simulating noise-driven unlimited population growth (deterministic)

For the stochastic simulations switch to the branch "stochastic".

## Usage
- The model parameters $\lambda$, $\sigma$ and $\mu$ as well as the simulation time and time steps can be modified in the parameter.ini file.
- The initial populations have to be set directly in the file main.py.
- Run the following command to produce the figures shown in the manuscript:

```bash
python3 main.py parameter.ini
